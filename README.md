# Multi-Cloud Platform (MCP)

A powerful platform for managing and orchestrating applications across multiple cloud providers.

## Overview

Multi-Cloud Platform (MCP) is a comprehensive solution designed to simplify the deployment, management, and monitoring of applications across various cloud environments including AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, and on-premises infrastructure. MCP provides a unified interface and consistent workflows regardless of the underlying cloud provider.

## Key Features

- **Unified Management Console**: Single pane of glass for managing all cloud resources
- **Cross-Cloud Deployment**: Deploy applications seamlessly across different cloud providers
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Define your infrastructure using declarative templates
- **Cost Optimization**: Analyze and optimize cloud spending across providers
- **Security Compliance**: Enforce security policies consistently across all environments
- **Automated Scaling**: Dynamically scale resources based on demand
- **Disaster Recovery**: Built-in backup and recovery mechanisms
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Comprehensive monitoring with customizable alerts

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Active accounts with one or more cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- API access and credentials for each cloud provider
- Docker and Kubernetes knowledge (recommended)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mcp.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure your cloud provider credentials
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials

# Start the platform
npm start
```

## Architecture

MCP follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Core Engine**: Handles the orchestration and communication between modules
2. **Provider Adapters**: Translate MCP commands to provider-specific API calls
3. **Resource Manager**: Tracks and manages all deployed resources
4. **Policy Engine**: Enforces governance and compliance rules
5. **Analytics Module**: Provides insights and recommendations

## Usage Examples

### Deploying a Multi-Cloud Application

```javascript
const mcp = require('mcp-client');

// Initialize the client
const client = new mcp.Client({
  credentials: './credentials.json'
});

// Define a multi-cloud deployment
const deployment = {
  name: 'my-application',
  components: [
    {
      name: 'web-frontend',
      provider: 'aws',
      region: 'us-east-1',
      type: 'container',
      image: 'my-app/frontend:latest',
      replicas: 3
    },
    {
      name: 'api-service',
      provider: 'gcp',
      region: 'us-central1',
      type: 'container',
      image: 'my-app/api:latest',
      replicas: 2
    },
    {
      name: 'database',
      provider: 'azure',
      region: 'eastus',
      type: 'managed-service',
      service: 'postgresql',
      tier: 'standard'
    }
  ]
};

// Deploy the application
client.deploy(deployment)
  .then(result => console.log('Deployment successful:', result))
  .catch(error => console.error('Deployment failed:', error));
```
